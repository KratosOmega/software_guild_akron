1. Plan your methods (check with instructor after all methods have been planned): 
   a. How many?
   => 3 methods
   b. Where will they be used? & c. Return types? & d. Parameters? & e. Names?
   =>
    - String playGames(int rounds)
      - it will be used in the pvsm
    - int compareRPS(int myRPS, int compRPS)
      - it will be used inside of the playGames method
    - String summary(int userWins, int computerWins, int ties)
      - it will be used inside of the playGames method

2. Flowchart each method (check with instructor after all methods have been flowcharted): 
   a. What is the internal logic? & b. What are the error conditions?
   => Check out the RefactorRPS_Flowchart

3. Implement and test (check with instructor after all methods have been implemented and tested)
   => Check out the RefactorRPS.java
