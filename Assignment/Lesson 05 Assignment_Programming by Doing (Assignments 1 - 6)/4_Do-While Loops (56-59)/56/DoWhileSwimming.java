/*
 * Q1: Yes, they do swim for the same amount of time if I enter "80.5" as input.
 * Q2: Both of their swimming time are changed. GALLANT swims for 0 min, and GOOFUS swims for 1 min.
 * Q3: GALLANT checked the temperature first before the swimming, since 0 min swimming time is shown.
 * Q4: GOOFUS didn't check the temperature and he dived right into the water, and then quit swimming.
 * Q5: "while" loop will do the validation check at the very beginning, however, "do-while" loop will perform action at least once no matter if the validation failed or not.
 * Q6: "while" loop = pre-test loop; "do-while" loop = post-test loop
