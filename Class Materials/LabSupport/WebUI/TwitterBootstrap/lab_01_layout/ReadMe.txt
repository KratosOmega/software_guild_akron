This is an exercise to get you used to twitter bootstrap's grid layout system.

FinishedLayout.png represents what your page should look like.

The Assets folder has the images to put into the layout.

Hint:

You will need to include the bootstrap css files on the page as well as the javascript file.

- You will need a nav bar
- You will need tabs

The rest should be accomplished with row and col tags.  I recommend starting with one of the navbar templates on the site.
