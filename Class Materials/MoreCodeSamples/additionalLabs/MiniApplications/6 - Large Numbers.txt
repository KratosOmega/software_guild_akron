Class to Handle Large Numbers
Difficulty: 6

Remember your classic game consoles?  These were limited in bits per data slot.  For example in an 8 bit system 255 
was the largest unsigned number.  Create a class that is limited to bytes as the maximum memory space and attempt to 
create ways to not only store larger values, but also add, subtract, multiply and divide them.  The result of any 
operation should be a new instance of the large number class.

Tips
-------------------------------
One approach is to think of a large integer as a series of numbers much line you would consider a string a series of 
characters. You can then work on each of these numbers individually as you carry out the various operations. Try working 
on the subtraction or addition methods first as these should be the easiest to implement.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Support some of the other operators such as modulus or see if you can apply various types of formatting to the number 
via a “ToString” method.
