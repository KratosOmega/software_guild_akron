Student Grade Book Application
Difficulty: 4

Write an application that keeps track of grades for a classroom of students. Allow the user (who is probably the teacher) 
enter in various assignments, their point totals and their student’s names. Then allow the user to enter in scores on each 
of these assignments for each student. The application will then automatically calculate the average score for each student 
and assign them a letter grade based on that score. Have it also calculate a class average.


Tips
-------------------------------
You can make the student a class and keep track of things like their name, address, phone and any special notes. The scores 
can be either implemented as parallel arrays or in a 2D array which may be wiser if you wish to use a simple loop to calculate 
averages for the student; and class as a whole. Student “Tom” can be stored in Students[0] and Scores[0][0] can be his score for 
the first assignment and Scores[0][1] can be the score of his second assignment. The class score will then be the sum of all students 
final scores going down the scores array.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Allow the teacher to mark the lowest two scores as “droppable” meaning that they won’t be calculated into the student’s overall 
average. A teacher may also want to add weights for various assignments. One assignment may be 50 points but makes up 40% of their 
overall grade for the class.
