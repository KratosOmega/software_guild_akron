Patient / Doctor Scheduler
Difficulty: 6

Make a program which allows users to schedule appointments with a doctor. The user can enter information about each 
doctor and their specialties. Then enter in patients. The program will then allow patients to choose a doctor and an 
appointment time. Keep in mind that a patient may have more than one doctor. One might be a surgeon and another will be a 
cardiologist. Don’t allow two patients to book the same time for the same doctor.

Tips
-------------------------------
First tip is to identify your objects so we can make them classes. First you have a doctor object, a patient object but 
is that it? What about the relationship between the doctor and the patient? Maybe there is an object there that relates 
the patient to the doctor. An appointment object perhaps? A day may be filled with half hour appointment objects and each 
appointment can have a doctor(s) and a patient associated with it. Explore the relationship between a patient and doctor 
at a given time before you code anything up. How do you make sure that a doctor is available or not for a given time slot? 
Think of loops.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Build in a mechanism to keep track of patient history and which doctors they saw and when.
