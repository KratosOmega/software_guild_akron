Hotel Reservation System
Difficulty: 6

Create a program which allows a user to take reservations for hotel accommodations. The user can enter a person’s name, 
phone, their length of stay and assign them to a designated room of their choosing. The system should prevent two different 
people from booking the same room.

Tips
-------------------------------
Think of this in terms of classes and arrays. A hotel can be thought of as an array of rooms. This array can be an array of 
Guest classes. You would store the guest's name and other attributes within the Guest class and then store that in the array 
at the designated room. If an array slot is empty, no one has booked the room.  

Consider how to handle rooms at different price points with different restrictions (smoking/non smoking, max occupancy, etc) 
The array of rooms in rooms[0] may be your $69 dollar a night rooms while rooms in the row rooms[5] might be executive rooms. 
These room arrays can be filled with room objects which have attributes like “non smoking” or “air conditioning”.
