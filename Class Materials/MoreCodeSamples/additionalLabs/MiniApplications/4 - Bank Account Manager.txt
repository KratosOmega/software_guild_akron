Bank Account Manager
Difficulty: 4

Design a program which acts as an ATM machine. The user can specify a PIN and it shows them a menu of their account 
types (checking and savings). Allow the user to deposit or withdraw money from a selected account type. Be sure to 
check that they can’t withdraw more money than they have or if they deposit more than $10k dollars, it lets the user 
know it will have to contact the bank manager to clear the deposit and won’t let them then withdraw any of that money.

Tips
-------------------------------
This is a classic example of class inheritance. Create an Account class which will serve as the basis of both types of 
accounts. A checking and savings account are both accounts right? They will inherit from the base Account class. Keep 
basic functionality in the base class like deposit() and withdraw() and then override them in the specific account types. 
A savings account may also have things like interest applied or a penalty for withdrawing any money. Take this into account 
when you override those methods. The variable “balance” would also be a protected member of the base class.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Allow the checking account to go into negative and apply an overdraft fee of $10. Don’t let the user go into overdraft 
protection more than $100. You could also prevent the user from making multiple withdraws if they are already overdrawn.
