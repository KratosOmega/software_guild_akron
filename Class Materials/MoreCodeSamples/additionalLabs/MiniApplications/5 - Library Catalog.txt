Library Catalog
Difficulty: 5

Build a virtual library where the user can enter books into their collection, give them an ISBN number and allow 
other users to then check them out. Build a menu to start where the user can add a book, remove a book, check it out, 
return it or exit the program. The user can locate a book by title or ISBN and check it out for a specific period of time. 
They can also return a book. If the return is late, they are charged a fee.

Tips
-------------------------------
Here the class can be a book and it may have information like the title, abstract, ISBN and info about whether or not it 
is currently available. If it is not available, it may also hold a return by date. The add book feature simply constructs 
the objects and puts it into a list to be managed and the delete functionality removes it. This would typically be done by 
another class that manages books objects. Would the add and delete functions be part of the book or the managing class? When 
a user checks out a book you will grab the book object, set its status to unavailable and set its return date. When they return 
it, take the current date, compare it to the return by date and if it is passed, you know to charge the fee. Otherwise, you set 
the availability back to available and remove the return by date.
