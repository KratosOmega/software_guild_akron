Employee Time Card program
Difficulty: 5

How much time has Joe worked today? Design a little application which will allow the user to keep track of employee 
work hours and calculate pay, overtime and any tax deductions that need to be made off of their paycheck. The user 
will have to enter the user’s name, the hours they worked, their hourly pay and choose between zero or many different 
types of tax deductions (child support etc). The user must also be able to calculate overtime based off a standard work week.

Tips
-------------------------------
The class here is the employee. Each employee will have a name, Social Security/Social Insurance number, their pay per 
hour and perhaps their date of employment. If you create a menu, which will allow the user of the program to quickly 
identify which employee they want, it will just be a matter of entering in the work hours and calculating their pay based 
off the employee class’ payrate property/method. Overtime is easy to calculate once you know how many hours are in the standard 
work week. Standard pay is hours worked * hourly pay. But this is only up to the standard work week hours. Once over it turns 
to time and a half (or some other factor) and becomes hours worked * (hourly pay * 1.5). The 1.5 is time and a half, but double 
time would be 2 and triple would obviously be 3.


Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Build in vacation tracking into the employee managing program and reject vacation requests if they have not earned enough time off.
