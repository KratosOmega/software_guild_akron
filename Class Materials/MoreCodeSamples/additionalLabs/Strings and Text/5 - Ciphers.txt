Ciphers!
Difficulty: 5

Create a program which implements the Vigenere, Vernam, and Caesar encryption methods. Ask the user for a string, or file to read, and have the text run through each of these ciphers. Let the use choose whether to output the data to the screen or back to another file.

Tips
-------------------------------
First stop, Wikipedia to learn how these ciphers work. Start with the Caesar cipher which is essentially a shifting of the alphabet. Take the letter “a” and shift it down 4 and you have “e” and a “b” becomes the letter “f”. Once you have this program working, then you can move onto the Vigenere cipher which uses shifts to come up with a more elaborate system of encryption.
