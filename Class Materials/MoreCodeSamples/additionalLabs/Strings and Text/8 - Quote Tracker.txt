Stock Market Fetcher
Difficulty: 8

Write a program which fetches the current market data for a given set of companies (using their market symbols) and outputs that market data to the user’s screen. Various pieces of data can be displayed including: current share price, daytime high/low, volume, last trade date, etc. Ask the user for many different market symbols and a particular stock exchange to pull the data from. Then have the tracker periodically update the user on the status of the stock.

Tips
-------------------------------
To download data from a URL, you will need to use the HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse classes

    HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
    HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse();

    StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream());
    string results = sr.ReadToEnd();
    sr.Close();
