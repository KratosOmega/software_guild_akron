Tips
-------------------------------
This is going to be all about regular expressions. Start simple and work to more complex formats. One of the easiest tests is to be able to specify a word or phrase, and possibly a file list to, then print all lines which contain that word or phrase to that file.

Various regex resources can be found on google.

Additional Difficulty
-------------------------------
See how many flags and formats of the original grep you can implement. Can you also specify piping? (Controlling where the output goes... to screen, file, etc)
