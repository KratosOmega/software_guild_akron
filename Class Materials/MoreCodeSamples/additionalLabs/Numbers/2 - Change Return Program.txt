Change Return Program
Difficulty: 2

Create a program where it shows the user a list of items to buy and their price. Then ask the user to pick an item and enter in the amount of money they would have inserted into the “vending machine”. Have the program calculate the change and return it to the user in the form of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. For example, if the user chooses an item that costs $1.25 and they say they give it $2.07 the program would print out 3 quarters, 1 nickel and 2 pennies as change for the user.

Tips
-------------------------------
First find out the difference between the item they bought and how much they are paying. Then look at using integer division to first calculate how many coins of each type to return. Then use the modulus (% operator in most languages) to determine the remainder of the change and repeat the process for each denomination. Be sure to check that the money they have inserted will first cover the price of the item! For example 89 cents / 25 is 3. This means 3 quarters with 14 cents returned.
