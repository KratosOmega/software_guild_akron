Title: Tip Calculator
Difficulty: 1

Create a program which asks the user to enter in a dollar value and the tip percentage. Then print out the subtotal along with the total plus tip (grand total).

This is a very simple program where you collect the value from the user, have the user enter in a tip value, add the tip to the total and print out the result. If the value the user enters is $10.00 and the tip is 15% then the total is $10.15.

Output:
Amount: $10.00
Tip:     $1.50
Total:  $11.50
