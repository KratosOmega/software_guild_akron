LCD/GCD Least/Greatest Common Denominator
Difficulty: 3

Create a program that asks the user to enter two fractions. Have the program find the least common or the greatest common denominator between those two fractions and print it out.

Tips
-------------------------------
Make sure to isolate the denominator first and find a multiple that goes into each of the denominators. You can start by finding the least common multiple (the smallest integer value that fits into both denominators). The greatest common denominator is the largest integer value which fits into both denominators.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
Try working on more than two terms.
