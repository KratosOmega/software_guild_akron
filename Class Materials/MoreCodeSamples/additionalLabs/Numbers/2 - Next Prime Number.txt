Next Prime Number
Difficulty: 2

Ask the user to enter a number and have the program find the next prime number after that value. If you don’t remember, a prime number is a number which can only be divided by 1 and itself. Thus if the user enters 3, have the program find the next prime number (5) and print it out.

Tips
-------------------------------
There are many ways to find primes. One of the simplest ways to find a prime is to simply start from the number the user enters and loop through the numbers one by one testing if it is prime. You can test if it is prime by trying to divide that number by all numbers starting from 2 until the square root of that number. If none divide evenly, it is prime. For example, to test if 11 is prime, we take the square root of it (which is a little over 3) and we test from 2 to 3. If none of them divide evenly (test the remainder of the division) then it is prime. Since 2 nor 3 divide evenly into 11, it is prime. Test 12... square root is again a little over 3 so we move from 2 to 3 and see if any divide evenly. Since 2 divides evenly into 12, it is not prime. Look at the modulus operator to help you do this.

Added Difficulty
-------------------------------
See if you can speed up this method by checking the last digit of the number. Obviously if the number ends in 2 it is even so it not going to be prime (unless the number itself is 2).
