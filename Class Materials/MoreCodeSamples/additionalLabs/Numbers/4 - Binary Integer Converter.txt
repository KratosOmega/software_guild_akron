Binary Integer Converter
Difficulty: 4

Make a program which has the user enter in either an integer value and prints out its binary equivalent or enter a binary value and it prints out the integer equivalent value.

Tips
-------------------------------
Start testing with some low well known decimal and binary values to make sure that it is first converting correctly. Use values you can easily calculate like 3, 4 and 5. Try taking a number, dividing it by 2 (using integer division) and recording its remainder. Do remember that N % 2 is always going to come out as either 1 or 0. Take the result of the divide and divide that by 2 again. Keep doing this until you can no longer divide it by 2 (again using integer division).

Added Difficulty

Now do it in Octal or some other base
